Read SPEC.md, spec/PLAN.md, and spec/TASKS.csv.

Constraints:
- DO NOT modify existing app features or UX in this step.
- Only propose a small PR that adds:
  1) docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (1 page mirroring /plan)
  2) .github/workflows/ci.yml (build+lint; no E2E yet if missing)
  3) docs/RUNBOOK.md (how to run dev/build/test locally)
- Branch name suggestion: docs/spec-sync
- Keep dependencies minimal.

Deliverables:
- Show the diff for those new/updated files only.
- Short checklist I can verify locally (2â€“3 bullets).
- Stop after preparing the PR. Wait for my review.
