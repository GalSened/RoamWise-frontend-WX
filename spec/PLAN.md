# RoamWise Implementation Plan

## Overview

Generate a concise, phased implementation plan for RoamWise - an AI-powered travel planning PWA.

**Project Status:** Navigation fixed, OpenAI API permissions issue blocking AI features

---

## Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

**Goal:** Restore core functionality and fix blocking bugs

### Tasks

- [x] Fix JavaScript syntax errors (duplicate declarations, missing try block)
- [x] Restore navigation system (all 5 tabs working)
- [x] Deploy fixes to production (GitHub Pages)
- [x] Validate frontend functionality

**Deliverables:**

- ‚úÖ All navigation tabs operational
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript console errors
- ‚úÖ PWA installable and cached

---

## Phase 2: Backend & API Integration (IN PROGRESS üîÑ)

**Goal:** Enable AI-powered features with proper Secret Manager access

### Tasks

- [x] Update OpenAI API key in Secret Manager (v3)
- [ ] Fix GCP service account permissions (secretAccessor role)
- [ ] Redeploy backend with correct permissions
- [ ] Test end-to-end AI trip generation
- [ ] Verify search API working

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] AI trip generation returns 200 OK
- [ ] Backend logs show no permission errors
- [ ] All 3 secrets accessible (OpenAI, Maps, Weather)

**Blockers:**

- Service account lacks `secretmanager.versions.access` permission
- Backend returns 503/PERMISSION_DENIED for all secrets

---

## Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance (PENDING ‚è≥)

**Goal:** Comprehensive validation of all features

### Tasks

- [ ] Run full Playwright test suite (42 tests)
- [ ] iPhone user acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Test report with 90%+ pass rate
- [ ] Performance scores: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] Accessibility score > 90
- [ ] Updated FINAL-APP-ANALYSIS.md

---

## Phase 4: Documentation (PENDING üìù)

**Goal:** Complete developer and user documentation

### Tasks

- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Developer setup guide (README)
- [ ] User guide for voice commands
- [ ] Secret Manager configuration docs
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Architecture diagram

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] docs/API.md
- [ ] docs/SETUP.md
- [ ] docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] docs/RUNBOOK.md
- [ ] docs/VOICE_COMMANDS.md

---

## Phase 5: Performance Optimization (FUTURE üöÄ)

**Goal:** Improve loading speed and offline capability

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement offline-first service worker strategy
- [ ] Add API response caching (localStorage/IndexedDB)
- [ ] Code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Image optimization and CDN
- [ ] Bundle size analysis and tree-shaking

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Offline mode working
- [ ] Initial load < 3 seconds on 3G
- [ ] Bundle size < 500KB gzipped

---

## Phase 6: Feature Enhancements (FUTURE üí°)

**Goal:** Add user-requested features

### Priority 1 (MVP+)

- [ ] Save trip history (localStorage + backend)
- [ ] Export trips to calendar (iCal format)
- [ ] Trip favorites/bookmarks
- [ ] Share trips via link

### Priority 2 (Nice-to-have)

- [ ] User authentication (Google/Apple Sign-In)
- [ ] Multi-language support (i18n)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Push notifications for trip reminders
- [ ] Collaborative trip planning

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] User account system
- [ ] Trip persistence and sync
- [ ] Social sharing features

---

## Technical Debt

1. **Backend npm package-lock.json** - Requires manual cleanup before deployment
2. **No error boundary** - Frontend has no global error handler
3. **Mixed promise/async patterns** - Inconsistent async handling
4. **No TypeScript** - Consider migration for type safety
5. **No automated E2E tests** - Playwright tests exist but not in CI

---

## Dependencies

### External Services

- OpenAI API (o3-mini) - AI recommendations
- Google Maps API - Location services
- OpenWeather API - Weather data
- Google Cloud Secret Manager - Key storage
- Google App Engine - Backend hosting
- GitHub Pages - Frontend hosting

### Critical Path

```
Phase 2 (Backend Fix) ‚Üí Phase 3 (Testing) ‚Üí Phase 4 (Docs) ‚Üí Phase 5/6 (Enhancements)
```

**Next Immediate Action:** Fix Secret Manager permissions (unblocks AI features)

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero JavaScript errors in production
- [ ] 90%+ test pass rate
- [ ] < 3s page load time
- [ ] 90+ Lighthouse score
- [ ] AI trip generation < 5s response time
- [ ] 100% uptime for backend (SLA)

**Status:** Phase 2 (Backend) in progress
