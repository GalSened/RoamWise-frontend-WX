## Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Conflicting JavaScript Files

**Problem:** Both app.js (old) and app-main.js (new) loading simultaneously
**Impact:** Null reference errors, broken functionality
**Fix:** Removed app.js script tag from index.html:1237
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: Hidden Search Results

**Problem:** Results populated but not visible (display:none)
**Impact:** Users couldn't see search results
**Fix:** Added `resultsList.style.display = 'block'` in search handlers
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 3: Missing Button Handlers

**Problem:** Category and quick action buttons had no event listeners
**Impact:** Buttons only showed visual states, no actual actions
**Fix:** Added click handlers in setupSearch() and setupQuickActions()
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 4: Class Name Mismatches

**Problem:** JavaScript looked for `.duration-option` but HTML used `.duration-btn`
**Impact:** Trip form buttons unresponsive
**Fix:** Updated all querySelector calls to match HTML classes
**Status:** ✅ Resolved
